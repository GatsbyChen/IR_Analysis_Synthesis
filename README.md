# IR_Analysis_SynthesisApology------This repository is under construction - check back soon if code is missing or broken or contact James Traer (jtraer@mit.edu) if you have any urgent requests or if you would like to be informed when I finally have the code uploaded - 2016/Nov/08Measuring Impulse Responses (IRs)--------------------------------To measure IRs broadcast a Golay sequence (created by running MakeInterleavedGolay.m) out of a loudspeaker and re-recording with a microphone.  The broadcast and recorded signal should be synced to the same clock and hence a multitrack recorder is ideal (we used a Tascam DR40) but a laptop can also be used using standard audio software, as long as the same program controls both the broadcast and recording.
