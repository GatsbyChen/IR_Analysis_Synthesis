-- Immediately --
=> IR_Analysis.m
=> fix that relabeling bug on line 163
=> clean up and comment the section where we make direct and volume components
==> when we adjust the DRR in hPrp we should really use the power, not the DRRs
==> move analysis plots from hPrp in IR_Analysis and save them in the folder specified by OtPth 
===> Naming convention with folders of Nbnds and flmz 
==> if that folder already exists no need to calibrate again
==> do something about right and left channel in calibration

-- Next time --
=> IR_Analysis.m
==> we should use higher sampling frequencies to fit the polynomial decays
==> adjust volume using volume and gain
==> if no calibration is specified use a delta function
==> compute H.spc after removing the noise floor
==> Put good comments in hPrp.m
==> fix FtPlyDcy.m
==> bootstrap variability in subband properties
==> print useful data to the command prompt

- move plots from "h<blah>" to "IR_<blah>"
- upload IR_Extract and hExtrct only

-- Eventually --
=> Code to compile IR statistics 
- IR_Statistics.m (hPltStts,hPrp,hExtrct)
=> Code to write all IRs to an HTML
==> plot statistics of all IRs
==> write an HTML file (that can have photos; also should include a header and a logical ordering scheme)
==> can be run on calibration IRs as well as on data
==> saves a single .mat file that can be opened for later plotting
- IR_Plot.m 
==> loads the big .mat file from IR_Statistics.mand runs hPltStts.m

=> Structires should be heirarchical:
>> audio: ts,fs
>> Broadband_prps: 
>> Subband_prps: Cgram stuff
>> apparatus: Mic, Volume
>> environment: 
- move stretches in wrappers we use over and over again into little subroutines in tools
- finish the code before writing the README
- add some examples (use our new AC measurementsand add some photos) 
- use this to add otehr data sets to webpage
- ask for feedback

Some specific tools:
- CatenateMeasurements.m
==> take two back to back recordings and catenate them into a single recording
