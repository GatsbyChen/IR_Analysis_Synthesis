Now:
=> IR_Analysis.m
==> make sure we can calibrate
===> compile multiple angles of speaker microphone to estimate volume vs direct
===> adjust volume using volume and gain
===> if no calibration is specified use a delta function
===> compute H.spc after removing the noise floor
===> take into account amplitudes
==> Naming convention with folders of Nbnds and flmz 
==> Put good comments in hPrp.m
==> fix FtPlyDcy.m
==> bootstrap variability in subband properties
==> check for pre-computed files to make sure we don't repeat the same computations over and over again

- move plots from "h<blah>" to "IR_<blah>"
- upload IR_Extract and hExtrct only

Plan:
-- Code to compile IR statistics 
-- Code to write all IRs to an HTML


- Structires should be heirarchical:
>> audio: ts,fs
>> Broadband_prps: 
>> Subband_prps: Cgram stuff
>> apparatus: Mic, Volume
>> emvironment: 
- print useful data to the command prompt
- move stretches in wrappers we use over and over again into little subroutines in tools
- finish the code before writing the README
- add some examples (use our new AC measurementsand add some photos) 
- use this to add otehr data sets to webpage
- ask for feedback

Some specific tools:
- CatenateMeasurements.m
==> take two back to back recordings and catenate them into a single recording

Sketch out outlines of modular codes
- IR_Extract.m (hExtrct.m)
==> return individual audio folders
==> return folder full of audio
- IR_Analysis.m (hPrp.m,hExtrct)
==> populate individual folders with new data
==> if an audio file exists that hasn't  been extracted run hExtrct.m
==> write a folder full of filtered audio
- IR_Statistics.m (hPltStts,hPrp,hExtrct)
==> plot statistics of all IRs
==> write an HTML file (that can have photos; also should include a header and a logical ordering scheme)
==> can be run on calibration IRs as well as on data
==> saves a single .mat file that can be opened for later plotting
- IR_Plot.m 
==> loads the big .mat file from IR_Statistics.mand runs hPltStts.m
